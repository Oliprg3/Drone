Fully autonomous drone system for food delivery using RL techniques.

# 2D Autonomous Drone Delivery Simulation

A Python simulation of drones delivering food on a 2D grid. This project shows drones navigating around obstacles, picking up orders, and delivering them automatically.

## Features

- Multiple drones operating at the same time  
- 2D grid with obstacles  
- Pathfinding using A* algorithm  
- Dynamic obstacle detection and rerouting  
- Battery management (low battery triggers return)  
- Orders assigned to available drones automatically  
- Animated visualization using Matplotlib
